    "### What are Agents <a id='7'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents combine the functionality of two components: LLMs and Tools. They empower an LLM to be able to execute additional tasks and reason through a problem. Namely, LLMs have knowlegde on data that was used at time of training. However, they lack knowledge about up-to-date happenings and information. They consist of the following components: \n",
    "- **LLM**: A pre-trained LLM.\n",
    "- **List of tools**: List of tools that give additional functionality to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "One use case of LLM Agents is to make it possible to have LLMs with access to real time information, like the current weather. Namely, when a prompt is called, agents have an LLM and Tools at their disposal. If no tool can be found to help in answering the question, the agent tries to answer using the raw LLM. E.g. for a given prompt \"What is the **usual** temperature in Amsterdam in winter?\", an LLM will likely already have knowledge. However, for a prompt \"What is the **current** temperature in Amsterdam?\", a weather API would be a better source of information, and in this case the Agent will decide to use the information from a weather tool. If such a tool is not available to the agent, the agent will respond that the requested information is not available. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, basically, you can think of Agents as usual LLMs but with more \"skills\". Cool, right?\n",
